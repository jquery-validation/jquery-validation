* Fixed exclusion of elements without rules from successList
* Fixed custom-method-demo, replaced the alert with message displaying the number of errors

* Added feature: Add errorClass to invalid fieldÔøΩs parent element, making it easy to style the label/field container or the label for the field.

* Fixed error label creation to use specified error class
* Added dependency feature: The requires method accepts both String (jQuery expressions) and Functions as the argument

* Renamed "min" to "minLength", "max" to "maxLength", "length" to "rangeLength"
* Added "minValue", "maxValue" and "rangeValue"
* Streamlined API for support of different events. The default, submit, can be disabled. If any event is specified, that is applied to each element (instead of the entire form). Combining keyup-validation with submit-validation is now extremely easy to setup
