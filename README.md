[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jzaefferer/jquery-validation.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jzaefferer/jquery-validation)

The jQuery Validation Plugin provides drop-in validation for your existing forms, while making all kinds of customizations to fit your application really easy.

## [Help the project](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18159)

This project is looking for help! [You can donate to the ongoing pledgie campaign](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18159)
and help spread the word. If you've used the plugin, or plan to use, consider a donation - any amount will help.

You can find the plan for how to spend the money on the [pledgie page](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18159).

## Getting Started

Include jQuery and the plugin on a page. Then select a form to validate and call the `validate` method.

```html
<form>
	<input required>
</form>
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.validation.js"></script>
<script>
$("form").validate();
</script>
```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

If you've wrote custom methods that you'd like to contribute to additional-methods.js, create a branch, add the method there and send a pull request for that branch.

If you've wrote a patch for some bug listed on http://plugins.jquery.com/project/issues/validate, please provide a link to that issue in your commit message.
